# ibm_m3_data_analysis
# Exploratory Data Analysis Lab

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques using Python. It is part of a module designed to teach data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis.

## Features

- **Data Manipulation**: Leverages `pandas` for handling and processing datasets.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes `matplotlib` for creating insightful visualizations.
- **EDA Workflow**:
  1. Data cleaning and preparation.
  2. Statistical analysis.
  3. Visual exploration of trends and patterns.

## Requirements

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
2. Follow the code cells to replicate the analysis process.
3. Modify the dataset or parameters for custom analyses.

## Outputs

- Clear visualizations showcasing data trends.
- Analytical insights derived from structured datasets.
